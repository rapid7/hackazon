Contributing patches

  Before you read this document, make sure you have read the general information on the 
  {{{./volunteering.html}Volunteering}} page. Credits to the Apache Commons project on which documents
  this one is based on.
  
  For guidelines on how to set up a development environment for Apache log4php, there is a 
  {{{http://wiki.apache.org/logging-log4php/SettingUpALinuxEnvironment} detailed guide}} on the 
  wiki pages.

* Respect the original style

  Please respect the style of the orginal file. Make sure that your additions fit in with that style.
  The framework has coding conventions and every contribution is supposed to adhere to them. 
  You might find it a little difficult to discover the conventions used by a particular class 
  but if you stick to the style of the original then that'll be fine. If in doubt, ask on the developers
  mailinglist.

  If a patch is submitted which doesn't satisfy the component's coding conventions, 
  then either a committer will need to rewrite the submission or it will be rejected. 
  Getting it right in this first place will save you having to rewrite it.

  Most important codestyles:

    * don't use vertical alignement
    
    * keep brackets on the same line as the method signature
    
    * keep brackets on the same line as control statements
    
    * always use brackets for control statements
    
    * use lowerCamelCase for naming methods and variables
    
    * don't use underscores (_)
    
    []

* Tabs not spaces

  PLEASE NO SPACES!

  Some IDEs include automatic source (re)formatting. If you use an IDE, please check that
  this feature is either disabled or set to use tabs.

  If a patch is submitted which uses tabs rather than spaces, then either a committer
  will have to reformat it before it's applied or the patch will be rejected. Again, 
  it's easier to get it right in the first place rather than have to reformat and resubmit your patch.

* Test cases

  Classes needs to be tested with {{{https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/}PHPUnit}}. If 
  you are not familiar with the principles of regression testing, then the 
  {{{http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/}PHPUnit manual}} is a good place to start.

  Before you submit your patch, please do a clean build of the full distribution and 
  run the unit tests (this can be done with <<<maven test>>>. This ensures that 
  your patch doesn't break any existing functionality.

  We strongly recommend that you create and submit test cases together with the rest 
  of your contribution. Test cases ensure that bugs stay fixed and features don't get broken. 
  Test cases will probably be needed anyway so submitting them saves time.

* Creating a patch

  The Apache log4php {{{./source-repository.html}source code repository}} holds the current source.

  Please create your patch against the latest revision of the files in the source code 
  repository since this makes the job of applying the patch much easier. 
  If you don't have a version checked out, then check one out. If you have, then please 
  do a fresh update before you make your changes.

  The patch should be in unified format. You can create a patch in this format  by using:

+--
  svn diff File >> patchfile
+--

  Eclipse has some diff features too. Please make sure you have your project as a patch root.
  Try to give your patch files meaningful names. This makes it easier for 
  developers who need to apply a number of different patches.

* Submitting a patch

  The preffered way of submitting a patch is by attaching it to a bug report in the project's
  {{{http://logging.apache.org/log4php/issue-tracking.html} issue tracker}}. Create a new bug
  report if necessary.
    
  Please make sure to mark "Grant license to ASF for inclusion in ASF works" when attaching
  the patch. This means you agree with providing us with the code contained in the patch
  under the {{{http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0}Apache licence}}.
