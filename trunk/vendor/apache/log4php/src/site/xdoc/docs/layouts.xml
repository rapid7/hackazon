			<p>Layouts are components responsible for transforming a logging event into a string.</p>
			
			<p>More often than not, users wish to customize not only the output destination but also the output format. This is 
  accomplished by associating a layout with an appender. All messages logged by that appender will use the given layout.</p>
			
			<subsection name="Layout reference" id="Layout_reference">
